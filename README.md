# Lesbian Cycle Tracker App! ðŸŒ¸

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I noticed there wasn't a simple, private way for lesbian couples to track their periods togetherâ€”so I built this cycle tracker app that lets you and your partner sync up your cycles! ðŸ’•

ðŸ”— Try it here: [Lesbian Cycle Tracker](https://lesbian-cycle-tracker-f4f1e.web.app)

## What it does:
- **Private & Secure**: Your data stays between you and your partner
- **Partner Linking**: Connect with your partner using secret codes
- **Shared Calendar**: See both your cycles on one calendar
- **Easy Tracking**: Just tap dates to mark your periods
- **Nickname Support**: Use nicknames instead of emails for privacy

It's completely free to use, and I'd love to get feedback from the community. If you have suggestions for new features or improvements, let me know! Would also appreciate any help spreading the word if you find it useful. ðŸ˜Š

Happy tracking! ðŸŒ™âœ¨
